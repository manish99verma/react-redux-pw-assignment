        "### 1. What is Redux and why is it used in web application development?\n",
        "- Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, often used with React (but can be used with other frameworks too).\n",
        "\n",
        "  It provides a single store (a central place) to keep all the data (state) of an application, so different parts of the app can share and update that data in a predictable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Why Redux is used in web application development:\n",
        "    1. Centralized State Management\n",
        "      * All the data is stored in one place, making it easier to access from any component.\n",
        "    2. Predictable State Changes\n",
        "      * Redux uses a strict pattern:\n",
        "        * Action → describes what happened.\n",
        "        * Reducer → tells how the state changes.\n",
        "        * Store → holds the state.\n",
        "      * This makes the app’s behavior more predictable and easier to debug.\n",
        "    3. Easier Debugging and Testing\n",
        "      * Since state changes follow clear rules, it’s easier to track bugs.\n",
        "    4. Good for Large Applications\n",
        "      * In big apps with many components, passing props manually becomes messy. Redux avoids “prop drilling” by letting all components connect directly to the store.\n",
        "\n",
        "  ---\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example flow:\n",
        "    * User clicks a button → an action is sent → reducer updates the state → all components using that state automatically re-render.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.  Explain the core concepts of Redux.\n",
        "- Core Concepts of Redux\n",
        "  1. Store\n",
        "    * The store is like a big box that holds all the state (data) of your app in one place.\n",
        "    * There is only one store in a Redux app.\n",
        "    * Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    import { createStore } from \"redux\";\n",
        "    const store = createStore(reducer);\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  \n",
        "  2. Action\n",
        "    * An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes what happened.\n",
        "    * It must have a type property (and can have extra data).\n",
        "    * Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    { type: \"INCREMENT\" }\n",
        "    { type: \"ADD_TODO\", payload: \"Learn Redux\" }\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  \n",
        "  3. Reducer\n",
        "    * A reducer is a function that takes the current state and an action, and returns a new state.\n",
        "    * It decides how the state should change.\n",
        "    * Example\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    function counter(state = 0, action) {\n",
        "      if (action.type === \"INCREMENT\") {\n",
        "        return state + 1;\n",
        "      }\n",
        "      return state;\n",
        "    }\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  4. Dispatch\n",
        "    * Dispatch is how you send an action to the store.\n",
        "    * Example\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    store.dispatch({ type: \"INCREMENT\" });\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  5. Subscriber\n",
        "    * A subscriber is a function that runs whenever the state in the store changes.\n",
        "    * Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    store.subscribe(() => {\n",
        "      console.log(store.getState());\n",
        "    });\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3.  What is Redux Thunk and how does it facilitate asynchronous logic in Redux?\n",
        "- Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that lets you write functions inside your action creators instead of just plain objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Normally in Redux, actions must be plain objects with a type. But this is a problem when you want to do asynchronous work (like fetching data from an API) because you need to wait for the data before sending the final action.\n",
        "\n",
        "  With Redux Thunk, an action can return a function that gets dispatch and getState as arguments. Inside this function, you can do async work, and then dispatch actions when the work is done.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Why it’s useful for async logic:\n",
        "  1. Lets you fetch data from APIs before updating the store.\n",
        "  2. Allows dispatching multiple actions — for example, one action when loading starts and another when data arrives.\n",
        "  3. Keeps async logic in one place instead of spreading it across components.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Example:\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "  // Action creator using Redux Thunk\n",
        "  function fetchUsers() {\n",
        "    return async (dispatch) => {\n",
        "      dispatch({ type: \"USERS_REQUEST\" }); // loading state\n",
        "\n",
        "      const response = await fetch(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users\");\n",
        "      const data = await response.json();\n",
        "\n",
        "      dispatch({ type: \"USERS_SUCCESS\", payload: data }); // success state\n",
        "    };\n",
        "  }\n",
        "  ```\n",
        "\n",
        "  Here:\n",
        "  * First action: tells Redux that loading has started.\n",
        "  * After API call finishes: second action updates the store with data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. What are the benefits of using the Redux Toolkit?\n",
        "- Redux Toolkit (RTK) is the official, recommended way to write Redux code. It’s like an upgraded version of Redux that makes the setup easier, code shorter, and development faster.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Benefits of using Redux Toolkit:\n",
        "  1. Less Boilerplate Code:\n",
        "    * In normal Redux, you write a lot of repetitive code for actions, reducers, and store setup.\n",
        "    * RTK combines these into simpler functions like createSlice and configureStore.\n",
        "  2. Easier Store Setup\n",
        "    * `configureStore` automatically sets up the Redux store with good defaults, like including redux-thunk by default and enabling the Redux DevTools.\n",
        "    * Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    import { configureStore } from \"@reduxjs/toolkit\";\n",
        "    const store = configureStore({ reducer: myReducer });\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  3. Built-in `createSlice`\n",
        "    * Combines actions and reducers in one place, making code cleaner.\n",
        "    * Example:\n",
        "    * Example:\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "    const counterSlice = createSlice({\n",
        "      name: \"counter\",\n",
        "      initialState: 0,\n",
        "      reducers: {\n",
        "        increment: state => state + 1\n",
        "      }\n",
        "    });\n",
        "    ```\n",
        "  4. Better for Async Logic\n",
        "    * RTK has `createAsyncThunk`, which makes handling async requests (like API calls) easier and more organized.\n",
        "  5. Fewer Bugs, More Readable Code\n",
        "    * RTK uses the Immer library under the hood, so you can write “mutating” code in reducers, but it still produces immutable state without mistakes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5.  Perform a simple state update with the Redux toolkit, Given an initial state with a user object: { name: 'Guest', isLoggedIn: false }, write a reducer function that updates the isLoggedIn property to true when a \"LOGIN\" action is dispatched.\n",
